// Final Capstone Project

// 1. Take/Create a project in any language you like which should use a database to get and store data. 
//         - Test it on your local machine and it should be working.


//  2. Make a git repo for the project with proper branches and use the proper branching strategy.
//         Example
//                 - main
//                 - develop
//                 - test
//                 - prod
//                 - or anything that suits

// 3. Setup a Jenkins server on your local machine via ansible using ansible roles.

// 4. create a PR builder job that should trigger automatically and run test cases whenever there is a PR created on a feature branch.

// 5. We should only be able to merge the code into the develop branch only after the PR build passes (create appropriate branch rules).

// 6. Create a CI/CD pipeline(using a Jenkins file).

// 7. CI/CD pipeline that should trigger when we merged the develop branch into the main branch and it should do the following
//         - build/test
//         - generate artifacts
//         - Dockerize the application and follow proper versioning of docker image (later it will be used for automated deployment)
//                 - example: u can use the commit hash from git to tag the image
//         - push to docker hub (Create your own docker file)
//         - Deploy to your local Kubernetes (minikube), deployment should be done automatically as part of your CI/CD process.

// 8. Set Up a monitoring stack using Prometheus and grafana
//         - it should scrape the metrics from an endpoint
//         - visualize them on the grafana dashboard. 
//         - example: Capture memory and CPU resources metrics for your application and for cluster
